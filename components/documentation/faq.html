            Go to
            <mark>[confluence_base_url]/admin/unmigratedwikicontent.action</mark>

            <p class="long">
            During the migration process, when the targeted confluence version doesn't have the GreenPepper plugin installed, the page is not migrated (due to unknown macro). This is not visible to you
            because the pages are surrounded by markups <b><mark>unmigrated-wiki-markup</mark></b>.<br /> Those markups keep the content of the page unmigrated by render the page correctly. Now, what is the
            problem with GreenPepper ?<br /> The GreenPepper <mark>greenpepper-import</mark> macro changed between the two version and it needs to be upgraded. So you need to force the upgrade again.

        <h2 class="question">On confluence 5, I have an error talking about CDATA, why ?</h2>
        <blockquote class="answer">
            <p class="short">
            You need to replace the {code} macro in you page with {noformat}.
            </p>
            <p class="long">
            Confluence 5 creates a complex structure to be able to handle the code syntax highlighting. That stuctrure inserts a CDATA block in the page. That is normal, HTML speaking.
            However Greenpepper tries to send the output page in an XML report. That page is included in a CDATA. What creates the problem is that a CDATA is forbidden inside a CDATA.
