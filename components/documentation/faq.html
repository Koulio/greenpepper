		<h2 class="question">I have migrated from confluence 3 to confluence 5. Since then, my fixtures are not found, why?</h2>

				Go to
				<mark>[confluence_base_url]/admin/unmigratedwikicontent.action</mark>
				and launch the migration of unmigrated pages
			</p>
			<p class="long">
				During the migration process, when the targeted confluence version doesn't have the GreenPepper plugin installed, the page is not migrated (due to unknown macro). This is not visible to you
				because the pages are surrounded by markups <b><mark>unmigrated-wiki-markup</mark></b>.<br /> Those markups keep the content of the page unmigrated by render the page correctly. Now, what is the
				problem with GreenPepper ?<br /> The GreenPepper <mark>greenpepper-import</mark> macro changed between the two version and it needs to be upgraded. So you need to force the upgrade again.
